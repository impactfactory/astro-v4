**Let's be honest: At the end of the day, at the end of the many good intentions, the motto "Man first" guides us.**

And if he should not be first, then this causes a storm of indignation. The space should not suddenly belong to the wolf, bear or beaver! The very last natural mountain valleys cannot endanger our energy needs! In a liberal society, we cannot simply ban technologies that poison the air we breathe and increase the global temperature! One cannot expect that things are produced in such a way that other humans and ecosystems do NOT have to suffer from it! IMPOSSIBLE.

In order to satisfy our physical and psychological needs, we sacrifice gigantic landscapes, whole ecosystems, the existence of inconspicuous and impressive animal and plant species. And in reality, only a small part of it is about real needs, but about convenience and self-invented demands. Ask the guy under the bodhi tree in India.

Despite more than 40 years of educational work, people fly around like crazy, drive, buy and make their dreams come true.

## Call it Poverty

Many of us make the experience that we lose with it also a world, which makes it possible for us to prosper and blossom inwardly and outwardly. To read repeatedly that there is only a single digit percentage of wild life left on earth actually makes one very sad, doesn't it? Should I really have to tell everyone in my pension that we used to have elephants, whales, lions, tigers, rhinos? In Switzerland even hedgehogs, all kinds of birds and so on? That there are unfortunately almost only cows, pigs and chickens left? A horror.

Is the center of the universe - I, I, I - really the place that makes us happy?

## Call it Wealth

Or could we consciously think of ourselves quite differently, insert ourselves differently into the web of life?

- more planetary gardeners than consumers?
- serve more than rule?
- long-term rather than short-term?
- enabling rather than consuming?

There has to be human intelligence for something; not just to lead us (and others) directly into extinction. And simply anything and everything we accomplish falls to others sooner rather than to me.

## Let's pick up the trail....

Let's see what the many small and big ideas and examples on Seeds can teach us about a wiser role. What asphalt crackers, beaver bombers, amateur natural gardeners and tree planters have discovered for themselves.
