\*\*Seeds is a project of ImpactFactory and thus of me, Kai Pulfer. After more than 15 years of educational work in the environmental field with environmental films, the development of an international environmental organization, and many changes in the world, I am now interested in a slightly different approach.

## The elephant in the room?

The question that has always moved me remains the same: Could it be that we need to change our collective consciousness in order to achieve a truly sustainable modus operandi of our civilization, integrated into the cycles of the Earth? Maybe not. But signs of yes for me are that we have a lot of greenwashing today, CO2 emissions are rising and rising even after years of talk, and many hopeful solutions have been disappointing. I'm not the anti-capitalist system critic, but some of today's basic pillars already seem to me to shift the problems instead of solving them.

And sure: some of our collective consciousness has changed, too. By consciousness I mean, by the way:

- our basic paradigms
- values
- perspectives
- ways of thinking and designing
- and perceptions

Creating a new consciousness seems to me an un-learning of old and a discovery of new. A teaching and learning how to observe, think and discover. More in wisdom than in knowledge.

New values and perspectives are coming, but also in a war with old values. Sometimes philosophical, sometimes economic sometimes even really physical war. As rosy and simple as we imagined 15 years ago, the world improvement is not after all.

## Can it be that...?

I am interested in whether instead of sensitization, whose time is probably over except for children and young people in our western countries, better paradigms, values, perspective ways of thinking and designing can also be discovered in things, "seeds", that we as individuals can do.

## Learning by Doing

This sounds abstract, but what it means is: Can permaculture methods be used to discover and learn to use other ways of thinking? Can the interconnectedness of life be perceived and understood by creating a bathtub pond? Do Seed Bombs in cities perhaps change the priorities of urban development departments? Are bold coral planters making environmental NGOs rethink their previous climate strategies?

## More agile, more direct

I am looking for an approach where most of the existing implementation capacity is not lost in fundraising, board reporting and administration. So for now it won't become an association, foundation or organization, rather a non-profit sole proprietorship or an open source project. Whatever allows for the most direct, agile development possible.

\*\*Seeds should be full of positive, amazing and exciting things.
