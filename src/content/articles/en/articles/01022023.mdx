Here we experiment, learn, rebuild, improve, download and upload every weekend. And this probably for quite a while.

The contents are dummies, filler material, improperly copied and distant relatives of the famous Lorem Ipsum.

Who visits the seeds in this early stage is probably...

- personal friend
- future comrade-in-arms
- programming support
- random surfer
- bot?

However, feedbacks, encouragement and ideas are always: **[welcome](mailto:kai@pulfer.info)**.
