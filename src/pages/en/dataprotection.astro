    <h2>General note</h2>

    <p>
      Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data
      protection provisions of the Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG. ),
      every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as
      protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these
      pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat
      your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data
      protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect
      the databases as well as possible from unauthorised access, loss, misuse
      or falsification.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.
      when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection
      of data against access by third parties is not possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through the use of this website, we cannot guarantee the security of your
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use
      of data as described below. This website can generally be visited without
      registration. In the process, data such as pages called up or the name of
      the file called up, date and time are stored on the server for statistical
      purposes without this data being directly related to your person. Personal
      data, in particular name, address or e-mail address, are collected on a
      voluntary basis as far as possible. The data will not be passed on to
      third parties without your consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Processing of Personal Data</h2>

    <p>
      Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable
      individual. A data subject is a person about whom personal data is
      processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless
      of the means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure,
      acquisition, deletion, storage, modification, destruction and use of
      personal data.
    </p>

    <p>We process personal data.</p>

    <p>
      We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. In
      addition, we process personal data in accordance with the following legal
      bases in connection with Art. 6 para. 1 DSGVO - insofar as and to the
      extent that the EU-DSGVO is applicable :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        lit. a) Processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject
      </li>
      <li>
        lit. b) Processing of personal data for the performance of a contract
        with the data subject as well as for the implementation of corresponding
        pre-contractual measures.
      </li>
      <li>
        lit. c) Processing of personal data to comply with a legal obligation to
        which we are subject under any applicable law of the EU or under any
        applicable law of a country in which the GDPR applies is applicable in
        whole or in part.
      </li>
      <li>
        lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the vital
        interests of the data subject or another natural person
      </li>
      <li>
        lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests
        of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights
        and interests of the data subject are overridden. Legitimate interests
        are in particular our business interest in being able to provide our
        website, information security, the enforcement of our own legal claims
        and compliance with Swiss law.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We process personal data for the period of time required for the
      respective purpose or purposes. In the event of longer-term retention
      obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we
      restrict processing accordingly.

    <h2>Privacy Policy for Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it
      possible to store specific information related to the user on the user's
      terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies make it
      possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of
      users of the pages, to analyse behaviour patterns of page use, but also to
      make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored beyond the
      end of a browser session and can be called up again when you visit the
      site again. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your
      internet browser to refuse to accept cookies.
    </p>

    <p>
      A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing
      purposes can be declared for a large number of the services, especially in
      the case of tracking, via the US site <a
        href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"
        rel="noopener"
        target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a
      > or the EU site <a

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy Policy for SSL/TLS Encryption</h2>

    <p>
      This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect
      the transmission of confidential content, such as enquiries that you send
      to us as the site operator. You can recognise an encrypted connection by
      the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to
      "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. When SSL or TLS
      encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by
      third parties.
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>Privacy policy for server log files</h2>

    <p>
      The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information
      in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits
      to us. These are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
      <li>Operating system used</li>
      <li>Referrer URL</li>
      <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
      <li>Time of the server request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. A combination of this
      data with other data sources is not made. We reserve the right to check
      this data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of
      unlawful use.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>

    <p>This website may use Google Maps for embedding maps.</p>

    <p>
      These services of the American Google LLC use, among other things, cookies
      and, as a result, data is transferred to Google in the USA, although we
      assume that no personal tracking takes place in this context solely
      through the use of our website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Google has committed to ensuring adequate data protection in accordance
      with the US-European and US-Swiss Privacy Shields.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further information can be found in the <a

        target="_blank">Privacy Policy of Google</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Data protection declaration for contact form</h2>

    <p>
      If you send us enquiries via the contact form, your details from the
      enquiry form, including the contact details you have provided there, will
      be stored by us for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event
      of follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Google Maps</h2>

    <p>
      This website uses the services of Google Maps. This enables us to show you
      interactive maps directly on the website and allows you to use the map
      function conveniently. By visiting the website, Google receives the
      information that you have called up the corresponding sub-page of our
      website. This takes place regardless of whether Google provides a user
      account via which you are logged in or whether no user account exists. If
      you are logged in to Google, your data will be directly assigned to your
      account. If you do not wish your data to be associated with your Google
      profile, you must log out before activating the button. Google stores your
      data as usage profiles and uses them for the purposes of advertising,
      market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an
      evaluation is carried out in particular (even for users who are not logged
      in) to provide needs-based advertising and to inform other users of the
      social network about your activities on our website. You have the right to
      object to the creation of these user profiles, and you must contact Google
      to exercise this right. Further information on the purpose and scope of
      data collection and processing by Google, as well as further information
      on your rights in this regard and settings options for protecting your
      privacy, can be found at: <a
        data-fr-linked="true"
        href="//www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy"

      >.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2>Note on data transfer to the USA</h2>

    <p>
      Our website includes tools from companies based in the USA. If these tools
      are active, your personal data may be passed on to the US servers of the
      respective companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a
      safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies
      are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you
      as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can
      therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence
      services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US
      servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing
      activities.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyrights</h2>

    <p>
      The copyright and all other rights to the content, images, photos or other
      files on the website, belong exclusively to the operator of this website
      or the specifically named rights holders. The written consent of the
      copyright holder must be obtained in advance for the reproduction of all

    <p>
      Whoever commits a copyright infringement without the consent of the
      respective copyright holder may be liable to prosecution and possibly to
      damages.

    <p>
      All information on our website has been carefully checked. We make every
      effort to ensure that the information we provide is up-to-date, accurate
      and complete. Nevertheless, the occurrence of errors cannot be completely
      ruled out, which means that we cannot guarantee the completeness,
      correctness and up-to-dateness of information, including journalistic and
      editorial information. Liability claims regarding damage caused by the use
      of any information provided, including any kind of information which is
      incomplete or incorrect,will therefore be rejected.

      principals or partners are not responsible for any damages, such as
